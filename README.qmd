# RdfCrate

`rdfcrate` is a Python package for working with RO-Crates which treats RO-Crates as RDF graphs rather than JSON objects.

**[Detailed documentation available here](https://wehi-soda-hub.github.io/RdfCrate/)**.

## Advantages

* Simple API that doesn't require understanding JSON-LD
* Library of types and properties to speed up development and ensure correctness
* Valid JSON-LD guaranteed
* Type checker friendly

## Installation

```bash
pip install rdfcrate
```

## Example

Let's say you have a directory with one file in it, which you want to document.
Here's how you could make an RO-Crate using RdfCrate:

```{python}
from rdfcrate import AttachedCrate, sdo
from datetime import date

crate = AttachedCrate("crate/")
crate.register_file(
    "monty.jpg", 
    sdo.name(sdo.Text("Montague Street Bridge"))
)
crate.add_root_entity(
    sdo.name(sdo.Text("Melbourne Bridges")),
    sdo.description(sdo.Text("Photo gallery of iconic bridges in Melbourne")),
    sdo.datePublished(sdo.Date(date.today())),
    sdo.license(sdo.URL("https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"))
)
print(crate.compile())
```
