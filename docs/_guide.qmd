This document describes the functionality of `rdfcrate` in more detail.

```{python}
from rdfcrate import AttachedCrate, sdo

crate = AttachedCrate("/path/to/crate")
```

## Adding Files

Files can be registered using `Path` or `str`:

```{python}
from pathlib import Path
crate.register_file(Path(""))
```



## Adding Directories

In addition to `register_file()`, there is also `register_dir()`, for creating `Dataset` entities:

```{python}
crate.register_dir("")
```


Start by initialising the crate:

```{python}
from rdfcrate import AttachedCrate

crate = AttachedCrate(".")
```

Existing files and directories within the crate directory are "registered":

```{python}
crate.register_file("parliament.png")
```

```{python}
crate.register_dir("belgrave_line/")
```

You can add metadata by importing properties from `rdfcrate.vocabs`.
Each property is instantiated like a class, with its value, as passed as a positional argument:

```{python}
from rdfcrate.vocabs import sdo
crate.register_file("flinders.png", sdo.name(sdo.Text("Photo of Flinders Street Station")))
```

You will always need to add the two mandatory entities:

```{python}
from datetime import date

crate.add_root_entity(
    sdo.name(sdo.Text("Melbourne train stations")),
    sdo.description(sdo.Text("Photos and metadata about Melbourne train stations")),
    sdo.datePublished(sdo.Date(date.today())),
    sdo.license(sdo.URL("https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"))
)
crate.add_metadata_entity()
```

Finally, you can write the `ro-crate-metadata.json` to disk:
```{python}
crate.write()
```

```{python}
! cat ro-crate-metadata.json
```

You can add metadata by 
## Thinking in Triples

When using `rdfcrate`, remember that every property is a triple of:

* Subject: the thing being described
* Predicate: the relationship between the subject and the object
* Object: the value or target of the relationship

If you're used to JSON-LD, it's good to understand that:

* JSON-LD objects are just triples that all share the same subject
* The `@type` field is just a specific `type` predicate
* You don't have to worry about `@context` at all. Hooray!

You can see this demonstrated when we convert from a JSON-LD entity into triples:

```{python}
#| output: asis
from rdflib import Graph
import pandas as pd

json_ld = """
    {
        "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
        "@id": "https://www.geonames.org/2152593/",
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Prahran"
    }
"""
graph = Graph().parse(data=json_ld, format="json-ld")
print(pd.DataFrame(graph, columns=("subject", "predicate", "object")).to_markdown(index=False))
```

## Vocabularies

`rdfcrate` provides a library of useful classes and properties that can be used as predicates (field names), or types.
The `rdfcrate.uris` module contains all URIs that are part of RO-Crate by default, which can help you when using autocomplete:

There are also [BioSchemas](https://bioschemas.org/) specific IRIs in the `rdfcrate.bioschemas` module.

## `rdflib` Types

While JSON-LD uses context to understand what is an IRI and what is a normal string, `rdflib` uses some special types to distinguish this. 
Likely every attribute you pass to `rdfcrate` will be one of:

* [`rdflib.URIRef`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/rdflib.html#rdflib.term.URIRef) for any identifier including types and properties. Everything inside `rdfcrate.uris` and `rdfcrate.bioschemas` is a `URIRef`.
* [`rdflib.Literal`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/rdflib.html#rdflib.term.Literal) for actual data like numbers and strings.
* [`rdflib.BNode`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/rdflib.html#rdflib.term.BNode) which are IDs for blank nodes for entities that don't really make sense as an individual objects.

Here's an example that uses all three to describe an event schedule that repeats every 3 years:
```{python}
#| output: false
from rdfcrate import AttachedCrate, uris
from rdflib import Literal, URIRef, BNode

crate = AttachedCrate(".")
every_three_years = crate.add_entity(BNode(), [uris.Schedule], [
    (uris.repeatFrequency, Literal("P3Y")),
    (uris.description, Literal("Repeats every 3 years")),
])
```

## Associating Entities

RDF doesn't really have a concept of nested entities. 
Instead, you associate two entities using a triple of the form `(Entity A's IRI, Some Predicate, Entity B's IRI)`.
In this example, we link the unnamed `every_three_years` schedule with a specific event:

```{python}
#| output: false
crate.add_entity(URIRef("https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/triennial"), [uris.Event], [
    (uris.name, Literal("NGV Triennial")),
    (uris.eventSchedule, every_three_years),
])
```


## Multiple Values

If you want to specify that a certain field has a list of values, you don't use a list inside the tuple.
Instead you repeat the same predicate multiple times.
For example:

```{python}
#| output: false
from rdfcrate import AttachedCrate, uris
from rdflib import Literal, URIRef

crate = AttachedCrate(".").add_entity(URIRef("#hook_turn"), [uris.HowTo], [
    (uris.step, Literal("Indicate right from the left lane")),
    (uris.step, Literal("Proceed into the intersection")),
    (uris.step, Literal("Wait until lights on the road you are entering are green")),
    (uris.step, Literal("Make a right turn")),
])
```
