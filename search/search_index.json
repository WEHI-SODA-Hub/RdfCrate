The problems stem from the fact that most resources use the identifier for the biological resource to identify the webpage associated with the resource, and even when resources such as UniProt do implement this \u2013 using purl.uniprot.org identifiers for the proteins and www.uniprot.org identifiers for the webpage \u2013 others linking to that data often conflate the two. While this separation is logically correct and enables separate statements to be made about both, it is often not found in Schema.org deployments.
